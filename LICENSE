## Definitions

“Organization” means a single legal entity and its controlled subsidiaries.

“Developer Seat” means a natural person who, during a 90-day period, writes, modifies,
or reviews code that directly integrates with, configures, or changes the Software.

“Redistribute” means providing the Software, or substantial portions of its source or
compiled form, to any third party as part of a development kit, library, SDK, plugin,
or service that exposes the Software’s functionality. Ordinary distribution of your
end-user applications that merely depend on the Software is not Redistribution.

“Managed/Hosted Service” means making the Software’s functionality available to third
parties over a network as a primary feature of your service.

For each version of the Software, on the date thirty-six (36) months after its first
public release (the “Change Date” for that version), the “Change License” for that
version becomes the Apache License, Version 2.0.
