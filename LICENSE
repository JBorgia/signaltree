Additional Terms:

1. ATTRIBUTION: You must retain all copyright notices and this license in all copies.

2. NO WARRANTY: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A

4. EXEMPTIONS: The Licensor reserves the right to grant exemptions from commercial licensing
   requirements at their sole discretion. Contact the author to discuss special circumstances,
   hardship cases, or unique use cases that may qualify for an exemption.

5. GOOD FAITH USAGE: This license operates on good faith. If you're unsure whether your
   use case requires a commercial license, please reach out to discuss.

6. RECURSIVE TYPING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS:

   a) EXCLUSIVE INNOVATION: The recursive typing system implemented in this Software,
   including but not limited to the "DeepSignalify<T>" type system, the signal-store
   pattern, and the method of achieving perfect type inference through recursive
   type-runtime alignment, constitutes proprietary intellectual property of the Licensor.

   b) SCOPE OF PROTECTION: This includes the specific approach of:

   - Using recursive type transformations that mirror runtime recursion
   - The "initiation defines structure, typing works as inferred" paradigm
   - Built-in object detection and handling in recursive type systems
   - Lazy signal tree creation with perfect type preservation
   - The method of maintaining exact literal types through deep nesting
   - Any derivative implementations of these core concepts

   c) RESTRICTED USE: You may NOT:

   - Extract, copy, or reimplement the recursive typing system in other projects
   - Create derivative works based on the recursive typing methodology
   - Use the recursive typing concepts in competing state management libraries
   - Teach, distribute, or license the recursive typing implementation to others
   - Create educational content that reveals the implementation details

   d) PERMITTED USE: You MAY:

   - Use the Software as provided under the main license terms
   - Build applications that consume the public API
   - Contribute improvements back to this project under a Contributor License Agreement

   e) VIOLATIONS: Any unauthorized use of the recursive typing system constitutes
   copyright infringement and breach of this license, subject to immediate
   termination of all rights and potential legal action.

7. ENFORCEMENT: The Licensor reserves all rights to enforce these intellectual property
   protections through legal action, including but not limited to injunctive relief,
   damages, and attorney fees.
