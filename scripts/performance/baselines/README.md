# Performance Baselines

Organized baseline files for benchmark comparisons.

```
baselines/
  micro/
    angular/
      baseline.json          # canonical baseline for Angular micro variance
    vanilla/
      baseline.json          # canonical baseline for Vanilla micro variance
```

Legacy flat baseline files at the root of `scripts/performance` remain for backward compatibility but new tooling will first look in the organized structure.
