The outcome is a framework that feels both intuitive and efficient â€” delivering a streamlined DX while optimizing performance where it matters most.\n\nEnvironment Calibration\n0\nReliability\nMulti-Core CPU\n+5\n10 logical cores - good for concurrent workloads\nModern V8 Engine\n+8\nChrome 140 - latest V8 optimizations, Sparkplug compiler\nmacOS Platform\n+3\nmacOS - generally consistent performance, good memory management\nMobile/Laptop Device\n-3\nBattery-powered device - potential thermal throttling, power management\nCalibrate Environment\nSelect Libraries to Compare\nSelect All\nSignalTree\n\nGranular reactive state with direct mutation\n\nBundle: 7.2KB\nStars: 2,800\nBaseline\nNgRx Store\n\nRedux pattern with immutable updates\n\nBundle: 25KB\nStars: 7,900\nNgRx SignalStore\n\nSignal-based store with immutable patterns\n\nBundle: 12KB\nStars: 7,900\nAkita\n\nEntity-focused state management\n\nBundle: ~40KB\nStars: 3,500\nElf\n\nModular reactive state\n\nBundle: ~5KB\nStars: 1,500\nNgXs\n\nCQRS-inspired state management with actions, reducers, and selectors\n\nBundle: ~30KB\nStars: 3,400\n\nNote: Bundle sizes are approximate and depend on usage patterns, tree-shaking, and build configuration.
