# SignalTree Intellectual Property Protection

## Recursive Typing System - Proprietary Innovation

This document outlines the intellectual property protections for the recursive typing system implemented in SignalTree.

### Protected Innovations

#### 1. TreeNode<T> Recursive Type System

The core recursive type transformation that maintains perfect type inference through unlimited nesting depth:

```typescript
export type TreeNode<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends (infer U)[]
    ? WritableSignal<U[]>
    : T[K] extends object
    ? T[K] extends Signal<infer TK>
      ? WritableSignal<TK>
      : TreeNode<T[K]> // üîí PROTECTED: Recursive type transformation
    : WritableSignal<T[K]>;
};
```

#### 2. Signal-Store Pattern Implementation

The approach that mirrors type recursion with runtime recursion:

```typescript
// üîí PROTECTED: Type-Runtime Alignment Pattern
function createSignalStore<T>(obj: T): TreeNode<T> {
  // Recursive call that mirrors the type recursion exactly
  (result as any)[key] = createSignalStore(value); // PROPRIETARY IMPLEMENTATION
}
```

#### 3. "Initiation Defines Structure" Paradigm

The groundbreaking concept where:

- Initial object structure locks in the complete type system
- Perfect type inference works forever after initiation
- Zero configuration required for any depth of nesting

#### 4. Built-in Object Detection System

Proprietary logic for handling Date, RegExp, Map, Set, and other built-in objects as primitives rather than recursively signalifying them.

#### 5. Lazy Signal Tree Creation

Advanced proxy-based system that creates signals on-demand while maintaining perfect type preservation.
