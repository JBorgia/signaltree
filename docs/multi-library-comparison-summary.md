- ‚úÖ Added route and navigation for easy access at `/library-comparison`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **LibraryComparisonComponent** (`/apps/demo/src/app/library-comparison.component.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Head-to-head performance comparison between state management libraries
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time benchmarking with 1000+ entity test scenarios
  - Initialization, read, write, and subscription performance metrics
  - Memory usage tracking and analysis
  - Statistical scoring algorithm with performance insights
  - JSON export functionality for detailed analysis
  - Responsive UI with winner determination and detailed breakdowns

#### 2. **Enhanced BenchmarkService** (`/apps/demo/src/app/services/benchmarks.service.ts`)

- **Reliability Assessment**: Environment detection, DevTools detection, power state monitoring
- **Statistical Rigor**: Outlier detection, median calculations, confidence intervals
- **Memory Profiling**: Before/after memory usage tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive timing and efficiency measurements

#### 3. **Deployment Infrastructure**

- **Production Script**: `/scripts/deploy-benchmark-site.sh` with automated hosting setup
- **Documentation**: `/docs/performance-hosting-guide.md` with comprehensive deployment strategy
- **CI/CD Ready**: Vercel and Netlify configurations with environment optimization

### Test Scenarios

The comparison platform uses realistic test scenarios:

```typescript
interface TestData {
  entities: TestEntity[]; // 1000+ entities by default
  counter: number;
}

interface TestEntity {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  value: number;
}
```

#### Performance Measurements

1. **Initialization Time**: Store creation and setup
2. **Read Performance**: 1000 read operations accessing entity data
3. **Write Performance**: 100 update operations modifying state
4. **Subscription Performance**: Effect/listener registration and triggering
5. **Memory Usage**: Before/after memory consumption analysis

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. **Fair Comparison Methodology**

- **Equivalent Scenarios**: Each library performs identical operations on the same data
- **Statistical Rigor**: Multiple runs with outlier detection and median calculations
- **Environment Normalization**: Reliability scoring accounts for browser, DevTools, and system conditions
- **Transparent Metrics**: All measurement code is open and reviewable

### 2. **Advanced Scoring System**

```typescript
getPerformanceScore(result: ComparisonMetrics): number {
  const totalTime = result.initTime + result.readTime + result.writeTime + result.subscriptionTime;
  const memoryUsage = this.getMemoryDelta(result);

  // Normalize and combine (lower is better for both time and memory)
  const timeScore = Math.max(0, 100 - (totalTime / 10));
  const memoryScore = Math.max(0, 100 - (memoryUsage / 100));

  return (timeScore * 0.7 + memoryScore * 0.3); // Weight time more heavily
}
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Insights**

- **Performance Improvements**: Percentage improvements across all metrics
- **Winner Determination**: Automatic best performer calculation
- **Detailed Analysis**: Metric-by-metric comparison with explanations
- **Export Functionality**: JSON reports for external analysis

### 4. **Production-Ready Deployment**

```bash
# Automated deployment script
./scripts/deploy-benchmark-site.sh

# Supports multiple platforms:
# - Vercel (recommended for performance)
# - Netlify (excellent for static hosting)
# - Custom CDN deployment
```

        "type": "positive"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Library Adapters

Each library follows a consistent interface for fair comparison:

```typescript
interface LibraryAdapter {
  // Initialization
  createStore(testData: TestData): StoreInstance;

  // Performance operations
  readValue(store: StoreInstance, path: string[]): unknown;
  writeValue(store: StoreInstance, path: string[], value: unknown): void;
  subscribe(store: StoreInstance, callback: (value: unknown) => void): () => void;

  // Cleanup
  cleanup(store: StoreInstance): void;
}
```

### SignalTree Integration

```typescript
private async benchmarkSignalTree(testData: TestData): Promise<ComparisonMetrics> {
  const store = signalTree(testData);

  // Measure read performance through signal API
  const state = (store as unknown as { $: () => TestData }).$();

  // Measure write performance through update API
  (store as unknown as { update: Function }).update((current: TestData) => ({
    ...current,
    counter: current.counter + 1
  }));

  // Measure subscription performance through effects
  const effectRef = effect(() => {
    const counterValue = (store as unknown as { $: () => TestData }).$().counter;
    // Track subscription updates
  });
}
```
