description: Guides AI agents integrating SignalTree (@signaltree/core and related packages) into Angular 20+ applications. Use when the user mentions SignalTree, @signaltree/core, @signaltree/ng-forms, @signaltree/enterprise, @signaltree/callable-syntax, @signaltree/guardrails, @signaltree/events, @signaltree/realtime, signal tree, reactive state, Angular signals store, or Angular state management; when the user wants to create, read, or update a signalTree() state tree; when the user is choosing enhancers (batching, persistence, time travel, devTools) or markers (entityMap, entityCollection, status, stored, form); or when the user is building reactive forms, syncing realtime data, or wiring event-driven flows on top of Angular signals.

# Using SignalTree

SignalTree: reactive JSON for Angular. State as shape. Signals at every path. Plain state object → `signalTree()` → every leaf = Angular signal via typed `$` proxy. No action creators, reducer functions, or selector functions — mutations live as named methods on an `Ops` service, derivations as `.derived()` tiers.

Mental model:

- Reactive JSON tree: `signalTree(state)` mirrors input shape. Leaves = `WritableSignal<T>`. Branches = typed accessors.
- `$` proxy: `tree.$.user.profile.name` = signal; `tree.$.user.profile` = group accessor.
- Read: `tree.$.count()` — subscribes reactive context.
- Write leaf: `.set(value)` / `.update(fn)`. Write branch (both forms are **deep-merge partial writes** — keys absent from the payload are preserved): `tree.$.user({ name, email })` (partial-merge object) or `tree.$.user((u) => ({ ...u, name }))` (updater function). No dispatch. There is no `tree.set(...)` — the root is callable: `tree(partial)` or `tree(updater)`.
- Enhancers: `tree.with(batching()).with(devTools())` — order-sensitive.
- Markers: `entityMap<User>()`, `entityCollection<User>({ load })`, `status()`, `stored(key, defaultValue)`, `form<T>({ initial: T })` — placeholders; `signalTree()` replaces each with its runtime API at that path. Branches are natively callable for reads AND writes (writes are deep-merge partial updates — keys not in the payload are preserved); the `@signaltree/callable-syntax` build-time transform extends call-syntax to **leaf writes** only. Arrays in leaves are `WritableSignal<T[]>` — use `.update(arr => [...arr, x])`, NOT `.push()`.

Don't introduce actions, reducers, action creators, or selectors — they fight the design. No module registration.

**App-wide state always uses one tree.** All domains (auth, settings, tickets, feature flags, …) go into a single `signalTree()` call — never one tree per domain or one tree per service. The pattern:

- `createAppTree()` — composes all domain state factories into one `signalTree()`, wired via an `APP_TREE` `InjectionToken` and a `provideAppTree()` function. **Also export `createBaseState()`** — tests need it to build isolated trees.
- `AppStore` — a single `providedIn: 'root'` class that injects `APP_TREE`, exposes `readonly $ = this.tree.$`, and namespaces per-domain `Ops` classes under `readonly ops = { … } as const`.
- `Ops` classes — one per domain (`DriverOps`, `SettingsOps`, …), each `Injectable`, each injecting `APP_TREE` directly for writes. No business logic in `AppStore` itself.
- **Consumers (components, resolvers, interceptors, guards) inject `AppStore` only** — never an Ops class or `APP_TREE` directly. Reads go through `store.$`; writes go through `store.ops.<domain>.<method>()`.
- **Ship `provideAppTreeForTesting()` alongside `provideAppTree()` from day one.** `AppStore` is `providedIn: 'root'`, so every `TestBed` that touches it (or any consumer that touches it transitively) will fail with `NG0201: APP_TREE` until tests provide the token. See [`reference/testing.md`](reference/testing.md).

Read [`reference/patterns.md`](reference/patterns.md) for the full wiring before writing any store code.

Component-local state (a single component's ephemeral UI state) is the only case where a tree lives outside `APP_TREE`.

Install:

```bash
npm install @signaltree/core
# pnpm: pnpm add @signaltree/core
```

See [`reference/install.md`](reference/install.md) for optional packages and peer-dependency details.

```ts
import { signalTree } from '@signaltree/core';
const tree = signalTree({ counter: 0, user: { name: 'Ada', email: 'ada@example.com' } });
tree.$.user.name(); // read
tree.$.counter.set(1); // write leaf
tree.$.user({ name: 'Grace', email: 'grace@example.com' }); // write branch
```

`$` proxy exposes signals — `@if`, `@for`, `[value]`, two-way bindings work natively. See [`reference/patterns.md`](reference/patterns.md) for template idioms.

Enhancer / package decision tree — start with `@signaltree/core` alone; add only when you hit the matching problem:

- Group CD notifications → `batching()` from `@signaltree/core`.
- Persist tree to `localStorage` → `persistence({ key, autoSave, autoLoad, debounceMs })` from `@signaltree/core`. Single leaf → `stored()` marker.
- `computed()` running too often → use Angular's `computed()` — it already memoizes by reference. SignalTree no longer ships a `memoization` enhancer (removed in 9.0.1); for deep-equality cache keys, derive via your own `computed()` with explicit comparison.
- Debug history, time travel, Redux DevTools → `timeTravel()` / `devTools({ treeName })` from `@signaltree/core`.
- Large app, bulk updates slow, diff-based patching → add `@signaltree/enterprise`, compose `enterprise()`. Read [`enterprise/SKILL.md`](enterprise/SKILL.md).
- Reactive forms (validation, dirty/touched, wizards, FormGroup interop) → add `@signaltree/ng-forms`. Read [`ng-forms/SKILL.md`](ng-forms/SKILL.md).
- `tree.$.field('value')` sugar over `.set()` → add `@signaltree/callable-syntax` (build-time transform, zero runtime cost). Read [`callable-syntax/SKILL.md`](callable-syntax/SKILL.md).
- Dev-time perf budgets, memory-leak detection, anti-pattern warnings → add `@signaltree/guardrails` (dev-only; noop in production). Read [`guardrails/SKILL.md`](guardrails/SKILL.md).
- Event-driven with Zod schemas, idempotency, retries → add `@signaltree/events` (ESM-only, requires Zod). Read [`events/SKILL.md`](events/SKILL.md).
- Sync tree to Supabase / Firebase / WebSocket → add `@signaltree/realtime`, compose `supabaseRealtime()` or `createRealtimeEnhancer()`. Read [`realtime/SKILL.md`](realtime/SKILL.md).

Composing enhancers — typical production shape:

```ts
import { signalTree, batching, devTools } from '@signaltree/core';

interface AppState {
  counter: number;
  ui: { theme: 'light' | 'dark' };
}

const tree = signalTree<AppState>({ counter: 0, ui: { theme: 'light' } })
  .with(batching({ enabled: true, notificationDelayMs: 0 }))
  .with(devTools({ treeName: 'AppStore' }));
```

Cross-package enhancers (`enterprise()`, `guardrails()`, `formBridge()`, `supabaseRealtime(...)`) slot into same chain.

Markers — placed in initial state, replaced by `signalTree()` with fully-typed runtime API:

- `entityMap<T, K>()` — O(1) CRUD: `addOne`, `upsertOne`, `removeOne`, `setAll`, `byId`, `all`, `clear`. Predicates: `.empty()` (the `.isEmpty` alias was removed in v11). Reads: `.count()`, `.has(id)`, `.where(pred)`, `.find(pred)`. Config: `entityMap<T,K>({ selectId, sortComparer })` — v10.5+ `sortComparer` keeps `all()`/`ids()` sorted (`@ngrx/entity` parity). `byId(id).field()` is body-granular (fan-out 1). `.computed('name', all => …)` slices materialize at runtime; read via `(tree.$.users as any).name()` (slice names aren't on the static `tree.$` type yet).
- `status()` — async op state. Write methods: `setLoading()` / `setLoaded()` / `setError(err)` / `setNotLoaded()` / `reset()`. v10.2 Promise-vocabulary aliases also work: `.start()` (= setLoading), `.setSuccess()` / `.succeed()` (= setLoaded), `.fail(err)` (= setError). Read predicates (canonical, bare names): `.loading()`, `.loaded()`, `.notLoaded()`, `.hasError()` — all callable signals, invoke them. (The `is`-prefix aliases were removed in v11.)
- `asyncSource<T>(config)` — load-and-expose (preferred over `status()` + manual try/catch). Auto-derives `.loading()`, `.error()`, `.data` accessor, `.refresh()` reload.
- `asyncQuery<TInput, TResult>(config)` — input-driven debounced query with built-in switchMap + dedup pipeline. Drive via `.input.set(value)`; read current result on `.results` / `.data`; status on `.loading()` / `.error()`. Lifecycle: `.rerun()` re-fires with the current input (bypasses dedup), `.reset()` clears state. No `.refresh()` — that's on `asyncSource` only.
- `entityCollection<E, K>(config)` (v11.2+) — **cache-aware entityMap that loads itself.** Use this instead of hand-wiring `entityMap` + `status` + a loader + a load-guard for any server-backed collection. Full `entityMap` surface (`all`/`byId`/`where`/`addOne`/`setAll`/…) PLUS: `config.load: () => Observable<E[]> | Promise<E[]>`, `staleTime` (`'30m'`/ms — skip refetch while fresh; default `0` = always stale), `swr` (serve last value while revalidating), `tags` (for `invalidateTag`), `persist` (offline-first hydrate-then-revalidate via a `StorageAdapter`). Methods: `.load()` (guarded — no-op if fresh OR in-flight, so N callers = one fetch), `.refresh()` (force, still single-in-flight), `.invalidate()` (mark stale — next `load()` refetches). Status: `.loading()`, `.loaded()`, `.error()`, `.lastLoadedAt()`. Tag-based push invalidation: `invalidateTag(tree, 'plants')` marks every collection carrying that tag stale — the clean seam for SSE/SignalR (`@signaltree/realtime`). Auto-loads on first `tree.$` access (unless `lazy: true`). **Keyed/scoped form (v11.3+):** `entityCollection<E, K, P>({ load: (p) => …, key: (p) => [...] })` parameterizes the collection by scope (region/customer/tenant) — call `load(params)` with the scope; freshness (`staleTime`) is tracked per-key, so a key change refetches even if the old scope was fresh, and a different key requested mid-fetch supersedes (last-request-wins). `currentKey()` exposes the loaded scope's serialized key; `refresh(params?)` forces a reload. Single-scope cache (no multi-key LRU yet).
- `asyncStream<TChunk, TState>(config)` (v10.5+) — **streaming/LLM token output.** ACCUMULATES chunks into state (unlike `asyncSource`/`asyncQuery`, which REPLACE per emission). Consumes `AsyncIterable | ReadableStream | Observable | Promise` (the AI-SDK transports), `Object.is` equality by default (no O(n) deepEqual per token), switchMap cancellation, error-resilient. `asyncStream<string,string>({ initial:'', accumulate:(s,c)=>s+c })`; drive via `.start(source)`; read `tree.$.reply()`, `.loading()`, `.done()`, `.error()`; `.cancel()`, `.reset()`, `.refresh()` (re-run the stream factory; alias `.regenerate()`). There is no `@signaltree/ai` package — wire your AI SDK in directly. Don't model tokens as a pushed array.
- `stored(key, default)` — single signal backed by `localStorage`.
- `form<T>(config: FormConfig<T>)` — tree-integrated form marker, **exported from `@signaltree/core`** (`@signaltree/ng-forms` is a separate FormGroup bridge, not the marker source). Config requires `{ initial: T, validators?, asyncValidators?, wizard? }`. Read the value by calling the marker (`tree.$.profile()`) or via the v10.4 alias `tree.$.profile.data()` — both return `T`. Bare-name accessors: `.dirty`, `.valid`, `.touched`, `.submitting` (NOT `.pristine`, NOT `.isDirty()`); value accessors: `.errors`, `.errorList`. Methods: `.validate()`, `.validateField(field)`, `.touch(field)`, `.submit(handler)` (handles touchAll + validate + submitting toggle + error trap internally).

Operating rules:

- Prefer `@signaltree/core` first. Add optional packages only for concrete problems.
- Never instruct consumers to install `@signaltree/shared`, `@signaltree/types`, or `@signaltree/utils` — private, bundled at build time.
- Never write to a signal inside `computed()` — read-only; side effects in `effect()` or event handlers.
- Custom markers: call `registerMarkerProcessor()` before any `signalTree()` call that relies on them.
- Don't reintroduce Redux-style patterns.
- When unsure of an API, read `packages/<pkg>/src/` — repo is source of truth.
- **One tree per application.** If the codebase has multiple existing stores (ngrx, services, etc.), compose them all into a single `signalTree()` behind `APP_TREE`. Creating multiple `signalTree()` instances for app-wide state is always wrong.
- **A migration is not done until the test suite is green.** Build-green is necessary but not sufficient — the test suite must pass before declaring the migration complete. The most common failure is `NG0201: APP_TREE` in `TestBed`s; fix it via `provideAppTreeForTesting()` ([`reference/testing.md`](reference/testing.md)), not by mocking `AppStore`.
- **Big-bang migration is the default.** Migrate every domain, delete every legacy store, drop the legacy package from `package.json` in the same PR. The hybrid-facade pattern is a _fallback_ for when PR-size, team-coordination, or release-cadence constraints prevent big-bang — never an end-state. If you ship a hybrid facade, it must include a `// TODO(legacy-facade): remove by <date/release>` and a tracking issue. See [`reference/optimal-implementation.md`](reference/optimal-implementation.md) and [`reference/migration-from-ngrx-signals.md`](reference/migration-from-ngrx-signals.md).
- **Big-bang means deletion in the same commit.** Standing up the new `AppStore` next to the legacy `signalStore` files is _not_ a migration — it's a hybrid you forgot to finish. Before declaring done, the legacy `*.store.ts` files for every migrated domain must be `rm`-ed (along with their `*.store.spec.ts` siblings and any re-exports), and `grep -rln '@ngrx/signals' <migrated-app-src>/` must return empty. If the grep is non-empty and you are not on the explicit hybrid-fallback path, **stop and finish the deletion before continuing**.
- **Pattern defaults you must apply** unless the codebase explicitly forbids them:
  - **`entityMap<T, K>()` for any keyed collection** (anything with `id`/key lookup, membership tests, or cross-references). Plain `T[]` is only correct for ordered, append-only, non-keyed lists.
  - **Per-domain state files** (`tree/state/<domain>.state.ts`) once the tree has more than two domains. Don't keep all state in one `app-tree.ts`.
  - **Multi-tier `.derived()` chains in named files** (`tree/derived/tier-<concern>.derived.ts`) once you have ≥ 3 derived concerns or any cross-tier dependency. See [`reference/patterns.md`](reference/patterns.md#splitting-derived-tiers-into-separate-files).
  - **Enhancer baseline for production trees**: `devTools({ treeName }) + batching() + timeTravel()` minimum. Tests skip enhancers; production does not. (`memoization` was removed in 9.0.1 — use Angular `computed()`.)
  - **Cross-domain orchestration belongs on `AppStore`**, not on any one Ops class. Single-domain methods belong on Ops; methods that touch ≥ 2 domains belong on `AppStore`.
- **Definition of done for a migration:** (1) zero imports of the legacy package in the migrated app, (2) legacy package removed from `package.json` (or, if other apps still use it, a tracking ticket exists for removal), (3) test suite green, (4) DevTools shows the new tree under the chosen `treeName`. The full checklist is in [`reference/optimal-implementation.md`](reference/optimal-implementation.md#definition-of-done).
