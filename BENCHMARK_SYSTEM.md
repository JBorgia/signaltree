# SignalTree Benchmark System - Setup & Expansion Ideas

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy from your repo**:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/jonathanborgia/code/signaltree
   vercel
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a personal access token that has `gist` permissions
   - Create token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
     - Select scope: `gist` (Create gists)

4. **Update API URL**:

   - Once deployed, update the API_URL in `benchmark.service.ts`:

   ```typescript
   private readonly API_URL = 'https://your-app.vercel.app/api/benchmark';
   ```

5. **Add route to app**:

   - Update `app.routes.ts` to include:

   ```typescript
   {
     path: 'benchmark-history',
     loadComponent: () =>
       import('./pages/benchmark-history/benchmark-history.component').then(
         (m) => m.BenchmarkHistoryComponent
       ),
   }
   ```

6. **Add navigation link** in your main nav/home page:
   ```html
   <a routerLink="/benchmark-history">Benchmark History</a>
   ```

### Step 2: Test Locally

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI dev
vercel dev

# This will run the API endpoints locally for testing
```

### Step 3: Deploy Demo

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Legal Considerations

### Already Implemented:

- ✅ Opt-in consent required
- ✅ No personal identifiable information collected
- ✅ Anonymous session IDs
- ✅ Clear data usage explanation

### To Add:

- [ ] Privacy policy page
- [ ] Data retention policy (e.g., keep data for 1 year)
- [ ] User data deletion request handling
- [ ] GDPR compliance notice for EU users
- [ ] Cookie consent (if adding cookies)
- [ ] Terms of service for benchmark submission

## 📊 Data Schema V2 (Future Expansion)

Consider adding these fields to enhance analysis:

```typescript
interface BenchmarkSubmissionV2 extends BenchmarkSubmission {
  // Network info
  connection: {
    effectiveType: string; // '4g', '3g', etc.
    downlink: number;
    rtt: number;
  };

  // Additional timing
  firstPaint: number;
  domContentLoaded: number;

  // Framework versions
  angularVersion: string;
  signalTreeVersion: string;

  // Test configuration
  testConfig: {
    depthIncrement: number;
    iterations: number;
    warmupRuns: number;
  };

  // Optional user feedback
  feedback?: {
    perceived Performance: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5; // "How fast did it feel?"
    wouldRecommend: boolean;
    comments?: string;
  };

  // Anonymized location (country-level only)
  location?: {
    country: string;
    timezone: string;
  };
}
```
