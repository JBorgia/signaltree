## 1. Definitions

- **“Agreement”** means this Commercial License Agreement and any attached Order Form / Schedule A.
- **“Organization”** means the Licensee entity and its controlled subsidiaries.
- **“Developer Seat”** means a natural person who, during a rolling 90-day period, writes, modifies, or reviews code that integrates with or changes the Software.
- **“Redistribute” / “Redistribution”** means providing the Software (source or compiled) to third parties as part of a development kit, library, SDK, plugin, or service that exposes the Software’s functionality. Ordinary distribution of end-user applications that merely depend on the Software is **not** Redistribution.
- **“Managed/Hosted Service”** means making the Software’s functionality available to third parties over a network as a primary feature of your service.
- **“Order Form”** means Licensee’s purchase document (or Schedule A) stating plan, seats, term, fees, and any SLA.

## 2. Grant & Scope

Subject to payment of Fees and compliance with this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee a
**non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide** license to:

1. Use the Software internally with up to the **number of Developer Seats** purchased.
2. **Redistribute** the Software as permitted by the selected plan (if purchased).
3. Provide a **Managed/Hosted Service** based on or exposing the Software’s functionality (if purchased).
4. Embed the Software in Licensee’s **SDKs, libraries, or developer tools** offered to third parties (if purchased).

Source code is provided to enable permitted uses. Except as expressly granted, all rights are reserved.

## 3. Seats, Contractors, and Build Machines

- Each Developer Seat is assigned to a natural person; seats may be reassigned as needed.
- Build/CI machines and staging/production runtime instances **do not** count as seats.
- Contractors working under Licensee’s direction count as seats unless separately licensed.

## 4. Copies, Notices, and Modifications

Licensee may copy and modify the Software as needed for permitted uses. Licensee must retain
copyright notices and this Agreement (or a reference to it) in source distributions and
reasonable attribution in documentation for SDKs/libraries/tools.

## 5. Restrictions

Licensee will not: (a) remove or alter copyright notices; (b) use Licensor’s trademarks except
to identify the Software; (c) disclose license keys publicly; or (d) circumvent technical
measures that protect Pro/paid features if present.

## 6. Fees & Payment

Fees are set forth in the Order Form / Schedule A. Unless stated otherwise, Fees are **annual,
prepaid**, and **non-refundable**. Taxes (if any) are Licensee’s responsibility, excluding
Licensor’s income taxes.

## 7. Support & SLA (if purchased)

If an SLA is included on the Order Form, Licensor will provide support according to the listed
response targets and support channels. Otherwise, support is community-based only.

## 8. Verification (lightweight)

No more than once per 12 months, upon 15 days’ notice, Licensee will provide a written
self-certification of: active Developer Seats and whether Redistribution or Managed/Hosted
rights are in use. No on-site audit unless mutually agreed.

## 9. Confidentiality

Non-public code, license keys, and any non-public information disclosed under this Agreement
are Confidential Information. Each party will protect the other’s Confidential Information with
reasonable care and use it only to perform under this Agreement.

## 10. Warranties; Disclaimer

Licensor warrants it has the right to grant this license. **THE SOFTWARE IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED
“AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND**, express or implied, including merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS/REVENUE, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED
THE FEES PAID BY LICENSEE TO LICENSOR IN THE **12 MONTHS** PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

## 12. Term & Termination

This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues for the Term on the Order Form
(typically one year) and auto-renews unless either party gives 30 days’ notice before renewal.
Either party may terminate for material breach if not cured within 30 days’ notice. Upon
termination (other than for Licensor’s uncured breach), rights to use, Redistribute, embed, or
offer a Managed/Hosted Service **cease**, except Licensee may continue to run already-deployed
end-user applications that merely depend on the Software.

## 13. Government & Export

Licensee will comply with applicable export control and sanctions laws.

## 14. General

This is the entire agreement regarding these commercial rights and supersedes prior proposals.
Assignments require the other party’s consent, except to a successor in interest in connection
with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets. If any provision is invalid,
the remainder will remain in effect.

**Governing Law & Venue:** State of Colorado, USA; courts located in Denver County, Colorado.
