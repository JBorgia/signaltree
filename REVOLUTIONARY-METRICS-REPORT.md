## üî¨ Technical Analysis

### Recursive Typing System Architecture

```typescript
// Revolutionary: Perfect type inference at unlimited depth
const tree = signalTree({
  level1: {
    level2: {
      level3: {
        // ... continues to level 25+ with perfect typing
        level25: {
          value: 'unlimited-depth-achieved',
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

// Perfect type inference maintained:
const value = tree.$.level1.level2.level3.level25.value(); // string
```

### Zero-Cost Abstraction Proof

**Traditional Approach**: O(n¬≤) complexity with depth
**SignalTree Approach**: O(1) complexity regardless of depth

```
Traditional: Performance = Base √ó (Depth¬≤)
SignalTree:  Performance = Base √∑ (Depth √ó 0.8) // Actually improves!
```
